# - Problem `1`

## Mathematical Formulation

### Sets
Set Name | Description 
---------|--------------
$P$ | The three types of products, High-Gloss, Semi-Gloss, and Flat


### Parameters
Parameter Name | Description 
---------------|--------------
$rawA_p$       | The amount of raw ingredient $A$ needed to produce product $p \in P$ 
$rawB_p$       | The amount of raw ingredient $B$ needed to produce product $p \in P$ 
$demand_p$     | The minimum demand to be met for product $p \in P$ 
$profit_p$     | The associated profit for product $p \in P$ 

### Decision Variables
Variable Name | Description 
--------------|--------------
$amtToProduce_p$ | The amount of product $p \in P$ to produce and is ion the set of integers


### Objective Function
$$
maximize \ theProfit: \sum_p amtToProduce_p \times profit_p
$$

\newpage

### Constraints

**C1:** Meet the minimum demand for each product
$$
meetMinDemand: amtToProduce_p \geq demand_p
, \ \forall \ p \in P
$$

**C2:** Cannot exceed the supply of Raw Material A
$$
rawSupplyA: \sum_p amtToProduce_p \times rawA_p \leq 4,000
$$

**C3:** Cannot exceed the supply of Raw Material B
$$
rawSupplyB: \sum_p amtToProduce_p \times rawB_p \leq 6,000
$$

**C4:** Ratio of 3:2 for High and Semi Gloss, respectively  

* Since $\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$, the amount of high gloss produced must always be $1.5 \times$ semi gloss
$$
highToSemiRatio: 1.5 \times amtToProduce_{Semi\in P} = amtToProduce_{High\in P}
$$

**C5:** Non-Negativity Constraints and is Integer
$$
amtToProduce \geq 0, \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

## Code and Output

### Code

### Output
* Not High to Semi is a 3:2 ratio and all demand and supply constraints are satisfied.

# - Problem `2`

## Additions to Model 
> Please assume that the mathematical formulation in the course videos are present as well (see code), just named objects are named differently but hopefully are convienent to interpret


### Parameters
Name | Description 
------|-------------
$M$ | "Big M," which is a large scaler used to help model disjunctive constraints

### New Decision Vars
Name | Description 
-----|--------------
$z$               | Determines which constraint to activate.
$totalProduction$ | Simple variable that is Zappers + Spacerays

### New Constraints
Description | Constraint 
-----|--------------
Set Total Production to Zappers + Spacerays | $setTotalProd: totalProduction = spaceRays + zappers$      
If total production is $\geq$ 400 | $isGreaterThan400: totalProduction  \geq 400 + M \times z$ 
then zappers must be 70% of total | $zappersAre70Perc: zappers \geq 0.70 \times totalProduction + M \times z$
If total Production is $\leq$ 400 | $isLessThan400: totalProduction  \leq 400 + M \times (1 - z)$ 
then no zappers at all            | $noZappers: spaceRays \geq totalProduction - M \times (1 - z)$


\newpage
## Code and Output

### Code
![ ]("Images/prob2CodeAndData.png"){ width=85% }

\newpage
### Output
* Optimal solution included more than 400, so zappers are 70% of production

# - Problem `3`
## Model Overview

### Assumptions and Calculations for Network Flow Diagram
* Starting/Ending inventory is 2,000
* In period 1, can only use inventory to meet demand since it takes a period to produce the chemicals. Hence, we can not manufacture in period 1.
* $\mu$ used to either show:
  * The 85:100 ratio when converting raw materials in production (seen as 0.85)
  * Converting the final product into dollars when selling, or
  * Showing the 8% degradation when storing the final product in inventory that did not sell (seen as 0.92, which is 1 minus 8%)
* To balance the network, a virtual node is used (the black node) and its dependent arcs use multipliers of 0. 
  * Note many nodes send through here because there must be minimum demand and maximum, therefore we cannot send all unused product through the demand and then to the balance node
  * So, some products must be zeroed out in the final product stage.
  * Period 4 assumes that some products are produced, but are zeroed out. This assumption is made since it takes a period in advance to manufacture the product. Node shown nonetheless.
* End of period 4 shown like another period for simplicity

### Sets, Parameters, Decision Vars
Description | Nodes in the actual model 
---------|--------------
$NODES$	| Set of all nodes in above network flow diagram: 
Inventory, plus ending i in period 4 | $i1, i2, i3, i4, i4end$
Produce the chemicals | $p1, p2, p3, p4$
Manufacture the Product | $m2, m3, m4$
The Final Product is made | $f1, f2, f3, f4$
Meet the demand | $d1, d2, d3, d4$
Flow balance zero out node | $z4$

* Upper and lower bounds use to direct the flow of the product

## Code and Output

### Model: `Problem3.mod`
* Used `gmcnfp.txt` from course website and renamed to `Problem3.mod`.
* Added `Problem3.dat;` `solve;` and `display x;`

### Data: `Problem3.dat`
![ ]("Images/prob3CodeAndData.png"){ width=80%}


### Output 
* Below shows how much of product is sent from node i to node j
* i is displayed on each row, and j is on each column
* For example, f3 sent 2,800 gallons to d3, interpreted as follows:
  * In period 3, 2,800 gallons of product were demanded.
* Note that values sent to virtual node means that nothing those values were not produced.
