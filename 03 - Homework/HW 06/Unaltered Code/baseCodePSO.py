# to get a random number between 0 and 1, write call this:             myPRNG.random()
# to get a random number between lwrBnd and upprBnd, write call this:  myPRNG.uniform(lwrBnd,upprBnd)
# to get a random integer between lwrBnd and upprBnd, write call this: myPRNG.randint(lwrBnd,upprBnd)

# you may change anything below this line that you wish too -----------------------------------------------------

# note: for the more experienced Python programmers, you might want to consider taking a more object-oriented approach to the PSO implementation, i.e.: a particle class with methods to initialize itself, and update its own velocity and position; a swarm class with a method to iterates through all particles to call update functions, etc.

# note: the feasible space is an n-dimensional hypercube centered at the origin with side length = 2 * 500

# the swarm will be represented as a list of positions, velocities, values, pbest, and pbest values

# position of particles -- will be a list of lists; e.g., for a 2D problem with 3 particles: [[17,4],[-100,2],[87,-1.2]]
pos = [[] for _ in range(swarmSize)]
# velocity of particles -- will be a list of lists similar to the "pos" object
vel = [[] for _ in range(swarmSize)]

# note: pos[0] and vel[0] provides the position and velocity of particle 0; pos[1] and vel[1] provides the position and velocity of particle 1; and so on.


curValue = []  # evaluation value of current position  -- will be a list of real values; curValue[0] provides the evaluation of particle 0 in it's current position
pbest = []     # particles' best historical position -- will be a list of lists: pbest[0] provides the position of particle 0's best historical position
pbestVal = []  # value of pbest position  -- will be a list of real values: pbestBal[0] provides the value of particle 0's pbest location


# initialize the swarm randomly
for i in range(swarmSize):
    for j in range(dimensions):
        
        # assign random value between lower and upper bounds
        pos[i].append(myPRNG.uniform(lowerBound, upperBound))
        
        # assign random value between -1 and 1   --- maybe these are good bounds?  maybe not...
        vel[i].append(myPRNG.uniform(-1, 1))

    curValue.append(evaluate(pos[i]))  # evaluate the current position

pBest    = pos[:]          # initialize pbest to the starting position
pBestVal = curValue[:]  # initialize pbest to the starting position


# Currently missing several elements
# e.g., velocity update function; 

# Objectives
## Track particle best position and value
## Track global best position and value
## Velocity and Position update functions
## Limits on guidence of the feasible particle's position
## velocity max limitations
## stopping criterion, etc.
## identifying the global best; 

## main loop,
