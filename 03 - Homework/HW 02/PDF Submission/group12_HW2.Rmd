## Mathematical Formulation

### Sets
Set Name | Description 
---------|--------------
$FRUIT$  | Fruit grade levels of grapes, which are `Grade A` and `Grade B` grapes 
$PRODUCTS$| Types of products to be sold, which are `Raisins`, `Juice`, and `Jelly`

### Parameters
Parameter Name | Description 
---------------|--------------
$amountOfFruit_f$     | *Pounds* of fruit grade ($f\in FRUIT$) available to use
$avgGradeOfFruit_f$   | Avg. point quality of fruit grade ($f\in FRUIT$)
$productLimit_p$      | Upper bound of number of products ($p\in PRODUCTS$) to produce
$poundsPerProduct_p$  | The amount of pounds associated with a single unit of product ($p\in PRODUCTS$)
$contrToProfit_p$     | The contribution to profit of product ($p\in PRODUCTS$)
$netProfit_p$         | The net profit (*net of OH allocation*) of product ($p\in PRODUCTS$)
$productGradeLimit_p$ | Requirement of mean point quality of a product ($p\in PRODUCTS$)

### Decision Variables
Variable Name | Description 
--------------|--------------
$produce_{f,p}$ | Number (*as integer*) of products ($p\in PRODUCTS$) to be produced by fruit grade ($f\in FRUIT$)

### Objective Function
$$
Maximize \ Net\_Profit: \sum_{f\in FRUIT,p\in PRODUCTS} produce_{f,p} \times netProfit_p
$$
\newpage

### Constraints

**C1:** For each fruit grade ($f\in FRUIT$), the number of products produced ($p\in PRODUCTS$) must be equal to numbers of fruit provided 
$$
maxWeight: \sum_{p\in PRODUCTS} (produce_{f,p} \times numbersPerProduct_p) = amountOfFruit_f
, \ \forall \ f\in FRUIT
$$

**C2:** For each product produced ($p\in PRODUCTS$), limit the number of products $p$ produced to $\leq$ to the demanded (product numbers)
$$
demand: \sum_{f\in FRUIT} produce_{f,p} \leq productLimit_p
, \ \forall \ p\in PRODUCTS
$$


**C3:** For each product ($p\in PRODUCTS$), the grade of fruit ($f\in FRUIT$) is greater than the minimum required grade of the product ($p\in PRODUCTS$).  
$minAvgGrade:$
$$
\sum_{f\in FRUIT} (produce_{f,p} \times avgGradeOfFruit_f) \geq productGradeLimit_p \times \sum_{f\in FRUIT} (produce_{f,p}),
$$
$$
\forall \ p\in PRODUCTS
$$


**C4:** Non-negativity constraints
$$
produce_{\ f,p} \geq 0, \ \forall \ f\in FRUIT, \ \forall \ p\in PRODUCTS \\
$$

# - Problem `3`

## Model Overview

### Assumptions and Calculations for Network Flow Diagram
* Below shows how we decided to balance the network with supply and dummy nodes
* In order to obtain a balanced network (i.e. supply equals demand), we must allow for all possible routes to have enough supply.
* Excess supply allowed on certain days is captured by dummy nodes so that the business does not actually produce the tires.
