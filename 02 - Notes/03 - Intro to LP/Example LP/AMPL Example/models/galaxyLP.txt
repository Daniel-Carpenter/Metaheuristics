# DECISION VARIABLES ---------------------------------------------

## Number of Space Ray Products
var product1 >= 0;

## Number of Zapper Products
var product2 >= 0;

# OBJECTIVE -----------------------------------------------------
maximize profit: (8*product1) + (5*product2);

# CONSTRAINTS -----------------------------------------------------
subject to plastic:    (2*product1) + (1*product2) <= 1000;
subject to labor:      (3*product1) + (4*product2) <= 2400;
subject to production:   (product1) +   (product2) <= 700;
subject to management:    (product1) -  (product2) <= 350;

# SOLVE ---------------------------------------------------------

## Solve the model
solve;

## Get the lower and upper bound shadow prices
## (Range of the decision variables in which the optimal solution stays the same)
