# Multiple Objective Optimization
* Concept of multiobjective optimization
* Examine tradeoffs among Pareto-optimal solutions frontiers
* Formulate multiobjective optimization problems in three ways: preemptive optimization, scalarization, epsilon-constraint
* Formulate goal-programming problems as a form of scalarized multiple objective optimization
* Use AMPL to implement the three methods and goal-programming
