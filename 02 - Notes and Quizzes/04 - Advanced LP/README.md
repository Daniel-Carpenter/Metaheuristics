# Advanced Linear Programming (LP)
> *The final test of a theory is to test it on the problem that originated it*

## Resources


## Goals of Module
1. Recognize and differentiate decisions, objectives, and constraints in optimization problems
2. Recognize `blending`, `multi-period planning`, `transportation`, and `assignment` problems
3. Separate problem types from problem instances
4. Write AMPL code for model files and for data files separately
