# Network Flow Modeling

## Goals of Module
1. Recognize the elements of a network flow problem in general, and specifically the minimum cost network flow problem (MCNFP) and . generalized network flow problem.
2. Formulate the transportation, assignment, shortest-path, max-flow, min-cost max flow as MCNFP.
3. Implement arc multipliers to model unit conversion and lossy flows.
4. Translate visual representations of network flow problems into mathematical expressions; and vice versa.
5. Write AMPL code for the appropriate data files associated with MCNFP and generalized network flow problem.
