# Branch and Bound
* Explain `LP relaxation` and `complete enumeration` for IP problems
* Use standard terminology to discuss the `branch-and-bound algorithm`
* Use `branching on fractional solutions to create sub-problems`
* Evaluate `incumbent solutions` and `LP relaxation solutions` to determine bounds in a `branch-and-bound tree`
* Recognize the three conditions when a branch-and-bound node should be fathomed
* Use `valid inequalities` to improve an IP formulation
