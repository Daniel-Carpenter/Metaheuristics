> Use's Darwins idea of survival of the fittest to obtain the best solution

## GA `Goals`
1. Design artifical software that retains natural environment that we try to emulate  
2. Better understand how natural environment evolves

## GA `Benefits` and `Uses`

## GA `Process`
> Iteratively, randomly, but intelligently search population, while using many simulanious solutions per iteration  

### `Repeat the Following Process Many Times` until Highly Improved Solutions
1. *`Start with random population`* of solutions  
    <img src = 'Images/process1.png'  width = 300> <br>
2. *`Combine best solutions`*, producing better solutions (hopefully)  
    <img src = 'Images/process2.png'  width = 300> <br>
3. *`Mutation:`* small % of the combined solutions are *modified*  
    <img src = 'Images/process3.png'  width = 300> <br>
    * Changes can *improve* or *reduce* the solution's quality
