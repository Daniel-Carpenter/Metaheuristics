# Heuristics Intro & Local Search
* Explain the differences between `exact`, `approximate`, and `heuristic methods`
* Encode solutions for heuristics
* Develop `neighborhoods` for `local search` techniques
* Develop `evaluation functions` for heuristics
* Solve problems using:
    * `hill climbing`, 
    * hill climbing with `random restarts`, 
    * hill climbing with `random walk`, 
    * local `beam search`, and 
    * `stochastic beam search`
