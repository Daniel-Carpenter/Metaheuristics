# Intro to Linear Programming (LP)

## Quick Notes Over Linear Programming

Solution Type   | Description   | Exanple
----------------|---------------|----------
`Infeasible`    | `Constraints` make it impossible to find an optimal solution          | Constraints make no feasible space
`Unbouded`      | Constraints do not actually constrain, so infinite solutions possible | Maximize profit, but did not put a limit on production capacity, so you can have unlimited produciton that results in infinite amounts of profit.
